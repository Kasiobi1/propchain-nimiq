// Real verification pipeline, per spec section 6.4.1:
//   Stage 1 (Groq, Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B — current Groq vision model as of Sep
//     2026): fast OCR/text extraction from the uploaded document image,
//     plus a name/address consistency check against what the seller typed.
//   Stage 2 (Groq, openai/gpt-oss-120b): the harder judgment call — does
//     this look like a real, internally-consistent document, and should
//     this submission be approved, rejected, or flagged for human review.
//     Originally planned to route through AgentRouter (a multi-LLM
//     aggregator) for this step per spec 6.4.1, but AgentRouter's client
//     fingerprinting rejects plain API requests — see runVerdict() below
//     for details. Both stages run on Groq now.
//   Stage 3 (Groq vision, optional — only runs if a selfie is provided):
//     basic liveness/face-match, comparing the selfie against the photo on
//     the ID document. See runLivenessCheck() below for the real limits of
//     this approach compared to a dedicated liveness API.
//
// NOT built: the video transcript match step from spec 6.4.1 — no service
// wired up for that yet.
//
// Response shape (restructured this session, was previously a flat
// {extraction, verdict, liveness, pipelineCoverage}):
//   { status, checks: { sellerInformation, assetInformation,
//     documentConsistency, anomalyDetection }, summary, liveness,
//     verificationToken, pipelineCoverage }
// Stage 2's prompt now asks the model directly for this per-category
// breakdown instead of one flat verdict/confidence/reasoning/flags object
// — same model, same call, just a different requested JSON shape. No
// numeric confidence score anywhere: the model is instructed to express
// uncertainty via "warning" status + explanatory text instead of a
// fabricated number.

2. Asset information — is what's on the document consistent with the asset type and description the seller gave?
3. Document consistency — is the document itself internally consistent and legible enough to trust?
