/**
 * Encodes NFT metadata as a `data:` URI instead of pinning to IPFS. This is
 * a real, standard technique (used by many on-chain NFT projects for
 * lightweight metadata) — no external pinning service or API key needed,
 * and the metadata is fully retrievable by any client that resolves
 * tokenURI(), same as a real IPFS gateway would provide.
 *
 * Real photos DO now have real storage — via Pinata (see
 * /api/upload-image/route.ts) — the image itself gets uploaded there, and
 * only the resulting IPFS URL is embedded here as `imageUrl`, which keeps
 * the on-chain data: URI small and cheap regardless of photo size.

// places and all three still named ipfs.ninja, which is why photos went
// on rendering blank after the upload side was migrated to Pinata: the
// upload succeeded and stored a working mypinata.cloud URL, then the
// display layer threw that host away and re-requested the CID from a
// gateway that no longer exists.
